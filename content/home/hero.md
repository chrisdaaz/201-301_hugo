This text introduces the core topics and foundational concepts of Materials Science and Engineering. It is structured within the framework of the Materials Science Paradgm. We cover introductory materials processing, structure, properties, and performance with particular emphasis on the relationship between structure and properties. We focus on conventional materials classes: metals, ceramics, and polymers -aand discuss their various properties - such as mechanical, electronic, thermal, optical, magnetic, and electrochemical. Broader themes that arise are how materialsâ€™ performance influences technological development, the economy, the environment, and society. This text is a pilot version intented to leverage computational tools to assist students in connecting conceptual understanding of materials science-relevent phenomenon with their mathematical models.
